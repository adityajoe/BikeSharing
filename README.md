# BikeSharing
Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.
The goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task to predict the number of bike sharing users on any given day.
